"So, how to get ROOT?"
Great question! 

## In Linux
To get ROOT in LINUX just log in into system how "root". But how? Type "su" command. In some distributions this user disabled or have your user password. Now you have ROOT.
## In Android
In Google's OS you MUST (Some kernels provide su binary by default) not have "su" command. What to do? Of course install it! The most popular binaries is SuperSU and MagiskSU. You can download they how flashable zip files.
### How install SU binary on Android
1. Custom Recovery. (Some manufacturers provides either custom recovery or recovery that can flash zip).
2. Downloaded ZIP file with binary. (Some manufacturers provides SU binary and ROOT).
#### If you dont have custom recovery
First install TWRP or CWM. ATTENTION!!! USE ONLY YOUR DEVICE-SPECIFIED TWRP OR CWM!!!
Download recovery image and flash it via adb.

Wipe data and flash zip via custom recovery. Thats all.
### How install SU binary via computer
1. ADB drivers.
2. Patched stock boot image via Magisk Manager.

#### Unlocking bootloader
Unlock bootloader before you can flash boot image. Some manufacturers wipes your phone... some manufacturers requires special code... some manufacturers not allowing unlock bootloader... some manufacturers already unlocked bootloader on their devices.

After unlocking flash via adb boot image
